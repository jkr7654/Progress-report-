Blackhole Simulation

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

make a background, install and init pygame successfully in my new laptop(pygame requires python in 12 or older version but won't accept 13, 14 or the latest(picky, I'd say))

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Object collision(if a human is near the black hole, how big is the black hole, how many times does it take for the human to cease out of existence) 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

new to pygame and trying new logic: debugging it is hard, especially not really experienced at coding(so many things to learn in pygame and it's time consuming)
